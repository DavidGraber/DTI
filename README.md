## Background
The field of computational drug design requires accurate scoring functions to predict binding affinities for protein-ligand interactions. However, train-test data leakage between the PDBbind database and the CASF benchmark datasets has significantly inflated the performance metrics of currently available deep learning based binding affinity prediction models, leading to overestimation of their generalization capabilities. We address this issue by proposing PDBbind CleanSplit, a training dataset curated by a novel structure-based filtering algorithm that eliminates train-test data leakage as well as redundancies within the training set. Retraining the current best-performing model on CleanSplit caused its benchmark performance to drop to uncompetitive levels, indicating that the performance of existing models is largely driven by data leakage. In contrast, our graph neural network model, GEMS, maintains high benchmark performance when trained on CleanSplit. Leveraging a sparse graph modeling of protein-ligand interactions and transfer learning from language models, GEMS is able to generalize to strictly independent test datasets.

## Overview 
This repository provides all the necessary resources to use GEMS, a graph-based deep learning model for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. Here we provide instructions for installing dependencies, and detailed guide for preparing datasets, training the model, and running inference. Below we also explains how to use the PDBbind CleanSplit dataset, a refined training dataset based on PDBbind introduced to eliminate data leakage and improve model generalization. Step-by-step examples are provided to help apply GEMS to their own data or benchmark datasets.

## PDBbind CleanSplit and GEMS
PDBbind CleanSplit is a refined training dataset for binding affinity prediction models that is based on PDBbind and has been filtered to reduce redundancy and train-test data leakage into the CASF benchmark datasets. The composition of PDBbind CleanSplit can be found in `PDBbind_data/data_splits/PDBbind_CleanSplit_data_split.json`. 

We provide PyTorch datasets of precomputed interaction graphs for **PDBbind CleanSplit**, for the complete **PDBbind** database (v.2020) and for the **CASF benchmarks** on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14260171). Each PyTorch dataset is available in five versions containing different combinations of language model embeddings in the graph features.

* `pytorch_datasets_00AEPL` -  ChemBERTa-77M included
* `pytorch_datasets_B0AEPL` -  ChemBERTa-77M and ankh_base included
* `pytorch_datasets_06AEPL` -  ChemBERTa-77M and ESM2-T6 included
* `pytorch_datasets_B6AEPL` -  ChemBERTa-77M, ankh_base and ESM2-T6 included
* `pytorch_datasets_B6AEPL` -  **Ablation:** ChemBERTa-77M, ankh_base and ESM2-T6 included, protein nodes deleted from graph

In addition, we provide GEMS models that have been trained on each of these datasets: 

* `model/GATE18e_00AEPL_d0100` - No embedding included (trained with GATE18e architecture, neglects ChemBERTa)
* `model/GATE18d_00AEPL_d0100` - ChemBERTa-77M included
* `model/GATE18d_B0AEPL_d0600` - ChemBERTa-77M and ankh_base included
* `model/GATE18d_06AEPL_d0500` - ChemBERTa-77M and ESM2-T6 included
* `model/GATE18d_B6AEPL_d0500` - ChemBERTa-77M, ankh_base and ESM2-T6 included
* `model/GATE18d_B6AE0L_d0100` - **Ablation:** ChemBERTa-77M, ankh_base and ESM2-T6 included, protein nodes deleted from graph

For each model, we provide five stdicts corresponding to the models originating from 5-fold cross-validation. Depending on the language model embeddings incorporated, these model showed different performance on benchmark datasets:

## Run GEMS on example dataset <br />
This repository includes two example datasets of protein-ligand complexes, where each complex comprises a protein stored as a PDB file and a ligand stored as an SDF file. Below are the steps to run inference or training using these provided datasets.

* **Dataset Construction:** Use the `GEMS_dataprep_workflow.py` script to preprocess the data and construct the PyTorch dataset. This script generates interaction graphs enriched with language model embeddings (e.g., esm2_t6, ankh_base, and ChemBERTa-77M). Specify the path to your data directory (containing PDB and SDF files) as an argument. If you wish to include affinity labels for training, provide the path to your labels file (CSV or JSON) as an additional input.
    ```
    python GEMS_dataprep_workflow.py --data_dir example_dataset_2 --y_data PDBbind_data/PDBbind_data_dict.json
    ```

* **Inference:** Run `GEMS_inference workflow.py` with the newly generated dataset file as input. This file will load the appropriate model and the dataset and create a CSV file containing pK predictions. If the dataset contains labels, it will produce a prediction scatterplot.
    ```
    python GEMS_inference_workflow.py --dataset_path example_dataset_2_dataset.pt
    ```
    
* **Training:** Run `GEMS_training_workflow.py` with the newly generated dataset file and a chosen run name as inputs. The script will split the data into training and validation datasets, train GEMS on the training dataset, and validate it on the validation set. A new folder named after the run name will be created to save the training outputs.
    ```
    python GEMS_training_workflow.py --dataset_path example_dataset_2_dataset.pt --run_name example_dataset_2_train_run
    ```


## Run GEMS on precomputed PDBbind dataset (Zenodo)

We provide PyTorch datasets of precomputed interaction graphs for PDBbind CleanSplit, for the complete PDBbind database (v.2020) and for the CASF benchmarks on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14260171). Each PyTorch dataset is available in five versions containing different combinations of language model embeddings in the graph features. After downloading the the pytorch datasets (.pt files), you can easily run inference on the datasets.
```
python GEMS_inference_workflow.py --dataset_path <path/to/downloaded/dataset_file>
```

To retrain GEMS on a downloaded pytorch dataset, run the following command:
```
python GEMS_training_workflow.py --dataset_path <path/to/downloaded/dataset_file>
```


## Run GEMS on PDBbind (without precomputed datasets) 
Download the PDBbind database from http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/. Then follow the steps below to construct a dataset of affinity-labelled interactions graphs and run trainining/inference. 

* **Prepare your data:** Save all PDB and the SDF files (including CASF complexes) in the same directory. Each protein-ligand pair should share the same unique identifier (_ID_) as filenames to indicate they form a complex. For example, use filenames like _ID_.pdb and _ID_.sdf to represent the same complex.
* **Prepare the labels:** Use the provided PDBbind data dictionary (`PDBbind_data/PDBbind_data_dict.json`) or parse the index file of PDBbind into a json dictionary (you can use `PDBbind_data/read_index_into_dict.py`, but you might have to adjust some paths)
* **Compute Language Model Embeddings:** This will compute ChemBERTa, ANKH and ESM2 embeddings (as desired) and save them in your data directory. We recommend running these scripts on a GPU.

    ChemBERTa:     ```python -m dataprep.chemberta_features --data_dir <path/to/data/dir> --model ChemBERTa-77M-MLM``` <br />
    ANKH:          ```python -m dataprep.ankh_features --data_dir <path/to/data/dir> --ankh_base True``` <br />
    ESM2:          ```python -m dataprep.esm_features --data_dir <path/to/data/dir> --esm_checkpoint t6``` <br />
  
* **Run the graph construction:** This will construct graphs objects for all protein-ligand complexes in your data directory, incorporating language model embeddings.

    ```
    python -m dataprep.graph_construction
    --data_dir <data/dir>
    --protein_embeddings ankh_base esm2_t6
    --ligand_embeddings ChemBERTa_77M
    ```
  
* **Run the dataset construction:** You need to provide the path to the directory containing your data (--data_dir) and the path to save the dataset (--save_path). In addition, provide the split dictionary and the dataset (corresponding to a key in the dictionary) for which the PyTorch dataset should be contstructed. To include the labels, provide also the path to the JSON file containing the log_kd_ki values. Finally, add the protein embeddings and the ligand embeddings that should be used to featurize the graphs (any combination of the embeddings included in the graph construction process is possible). This will generate a pytorch dataset of affinity-labelled interactions graphs featurized with the desired language model embeddings.

    **PDBbind training dataset:** Replace "train" with "casf2013" or "casf2016" to build datasets for CASF
    ```
    python -m dataprep.construct_dataset
    --data_dir <data/dir> 
    --save_path <save/output/path/.pt>
    --data_split PDBbind_data/data_splits/PDBbind_data_split.json
    --dataset train
    --data_dict PDBbind_data/PDBbind_data_dict.json 
    --protein_embeddings ankh_base esm2_t6
    --ligand_embeddings ChemBERTa_77M
    ```
    


    **PDBbind CleanSplit training dataset:** Replace "train" with "casf2013" or "casf2016" to build datasets for CASF
    ```
    python -m dataprep.construct_dataset
    --data_dir <data/dir> 
    --save_path <save/output/path/.pt>
    --data_split PDBbind_data/data_splits/PDBbind_CleanSplit_data_split.json
    --dataset train
    --data_dict PDBbind_data/PDBbind_data_dict.json 
    --protein_embeddings ankh_base esm2_t6
    --ligand_embeddings ChemBERTa_77M
    ```
  


* **Inference:** Run the inference workflow using the generated pytorch dataset as input:
    ```
    python GEMS_inference_workflow.py --dataset_path <path/to/dataset_file>
    ```

* **Training:** Run the training workflow using the generated pytorch dataset as input:
    ```
    python GEMS_training_workflow.py --dataset_path <path/to/dataset_file>
    ```




## Run GEMS on your own data
You can easily run inference or train GEMS on your own protein-ligand complex structures by following the steps below:

**Prepare your data:** Ensure that all complexes are stored in the same directory, with proteins saved as PDB files and their corresponding ligands saved as SDF files. Each protein-ligand pair should share the same unique identifier (_ID_) as filenames to indicate they form a complex. For example, use filenames like _ID_.pdb and _ID_.sdf to represent the same complex. 
**Prepare your labels:** If you have affinity labels for your complexes, save them as CSV with two columns. Column 1 header should be "key" and column 2 header should be "log_kd_ki". You can also create a dictionary mapping _ID_ to pK values and save it as a json file following the structure of `PDBbind_data/PDBbind_data_dict.json` 
**Run the data preparation** using  
    ```
    python GEMS_dataprep_workflow.py --data_dir example_dataset_2 --y_data PDBbind_data/PDBbind_data_dict.json
    ```
